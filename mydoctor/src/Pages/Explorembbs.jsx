        The fees of government medical colleges are very low as compared to private medical colleges and can be easily paid by students who come from middle-class families. But, getting enrolled in public medical colleges is a matter of sheer luck due to the criteria of merit and performance. The sole purpose of government medical colleges is to promote quality medical education by supporting the students financially.
        <br /><br />
        On average, the cost of MBBS in Georgia tuition fee in government medical colleges can be around 4,000 to 6,000 USD per annum. However, the hostel accommodation and food expenses are excluded but are not very high either.

        The fees structure of private medical colleges is enormously expensive due to better facilities, high-class infrastructure, a larger number of teaching faculty, etc. Although private medical colleges are very good to study at, they are not a cakewalk for everyone due to their tremendously high fees structure.
        <br /><br />
        On average, the cost of MBBS in Georgia tuition fee in private medical colleges can be around Rs. 12,00,000 to Rs. 35,00,000 per annum. Moreover, the living costs usually sum up to around Rs. 20,000 or more ‚Äì depending upon the city, location, preferences, etc.

        Till 2013, there were multiple numbers of entrance examinations required for getting admission in MBBS in Georgia. This caused a lot of problems, pressure and confusion amongst students and parents. After a lot of discussions and meetings, it was declared that there will be just one exam that will be mandatory for getting MBBS in Georgia admission.
        <br /><br />
        This is when NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) came into existence and replaced all other major exams such as AIPMT, PGIMER, JIPMER, State-wise CETs such as MHCET, WBJEE, EAMCET etc. NEET is now the only entrance test required for medical courses in government as well as private medical colleges in Georgia.
        <br /><br />
        The syllabus is based on the CBSE curriculum for the 11th and 12th standard which is easy for ISC students as well. The examination is held in the form of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and if the students can achieve a minimum of 50 percentile in NEET, they are eligible for getting MBBS in Georgia admission.
